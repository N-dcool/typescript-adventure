# TypeScript

This project was created to showcase my understanding of various technical terms in TypeScript. It includes the following features:

- [ ] **Type annotations**: The project includes type annotations throughout the code to ensure that variables are used correctly.
- [ ] **Interfaces**: The code uses interfaces to define object shapes and ensure consistency across the project.
- [ ] **Classes**: Classes are used to organize code and create reusable objects with properties and methods.
- [ ] **Generics**: The project demonstrates my understanding of generics, which allow for the creation of reusable code that can work with a variety of types.
- [ ] **Modules**: The code is organized into modules for easy navigation and to ensure that functions and classes are only accessible where they are needed.
